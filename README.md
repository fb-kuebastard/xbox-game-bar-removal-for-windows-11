# xbox-game-bar-removal-for-windows-11
this script i made becasue i accidently updating my xbox gamebar to the latest version and i got performance decrease, such a micro stuttering in game and bad result while recording. and if i use default from windows 11 there is no issues.

this script will completely remove xbox gamebar and their component! except Xbox TCUI

from source i read, if we remove tcui it will break another app function like store. [CLICK HERE TO READ](https://www.vacuumbreather.com/index.php/blog/item/81-windows-10-1809-built-in-apps-what-to-keep)

if you ask for usage, it's easy to use just follow this step:
1. Open powershell with run as admin
2. Copy this command to enable execution of PowerShell scripts:
Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted
3. Or unblock PowerShell scripts and modules within this directory:
ls -Recurse *.ps1 | Unblock-File
ls -Recurse *.psm1 | Unblock-File
4. and execute the script:
.\remove-game-bar
